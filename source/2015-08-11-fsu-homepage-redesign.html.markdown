As part of a recent job interview process, I was challenged to redesign the Florida State University Seminoles website. I had several requirements that I needed to follow which were provided to me by the business. Other than that, the rest was up to me! Over the course of three days, I started from a sketch and worked my way up to a high-fidelity mockup. I decided to keep my notes here in my journal about the process that I took to complete the challenge.

##Step One: Requirement Review##
The first and most important part of the process was following the directions. If all else fails, at least put my name on it and make sure it has everything that the business asked for. In no particular order;

* Follow Florida Stateâ€™s branding and identity
* Keep all of the elements already present on the homepage, they were open to new features too 
* Add a re-skinned version of the scores and news ribbon (provided)
* The site needs to be responsive
* The footer is optional
* Remove the NeueLion logo 
* Font selection is up to me

##Step Two: Evaluation##
I started my redesign process by doing an informal evaluation and inventory of the current Seminoles website <http://www.seminoles.com> -I focused on features and aesthetics. I broke the site down my section and/or feature and recorded as follows;

![FSU Homepage](2015-08-11-fsu-homepage-redesign/fsu_homepage_original.jpg)

__Header__

* It's too busy, there are a lot of elements (distractions) compressed into a small space
* My gut tells me to clean it up, the navigation is meant to be a guide, not the entire experience itself
* I'd like to see individual sections dedicated to booster, store, & tickets
* Add social media, college students all have accounts and they can engage here without taking up too much space. this will help content go viral

__Hero__

* The pictures are really small
* Add controls to change the image, maybe swipe on a phone
* Add more spacing around the text, it's crowded
* Add some dynamic shapes, it's too blocky... this is football we're talking about, very action oriented
* Keep schedule and results close to the top but use the re-skinned ribbon

__News__

* Show the entire headline
* Show a blurb/teaser
* Show the date
* Show the category
* Add tweets to section 
* Add photo gallery to section 
* Keep the load more button 
* Add the podcast to the media section
* Add filter to sort types of media 
* Add better play button to videos

__Stay Connected__

* Facebook doesn't fit, remove it... add icon to header 
* Move tweets to media section
*Keep newsletter sign up in footer, something tells me not a lot of people use the email news letters (what are they for)

__Photo Gallery__

* Move to media section 

__Podcast__

* Move below media section (group with media) 

__Champions Campaign__

* I read about this online, it's very important... I want to make a bigger call to action

__Footer__

* Use the same background color and text color
* Make the logos in the footer white
* Remove the NeuLion and IMG logos
* Keep FSU logo, it looks cool

__Body__

* Background pattern is neat but it's also distracting... maybe use it on larger screens
* It's responsive, keep that in mind on the new design


##Step Three: Personas##
My next step was to create three different personas that best represented the user types. I wasn't able to validate my personas but being a football fan myself, I was able to make some educated guesses -I also made some assumptions. I tried putting myself into the shoes of a college fan. My first thought, what makes a good fan? Then, what's important to me as a fan? Finally, how would I experience Seminoles sports online and on the campus? How can I as a website designer help them bind the two experiences? Thus, my personas started to form;

##Step Four: Market Review##
I spent some time reviewing other NCAA  websites to get an idea of what the market is used to seeing and to get some ideas for my layout. There were a few sites in particular that I liked because of their clean style. Those sites were;

* <http://www.goducks.com/>
* <http://www.txstatebobcats.com/>
* <http://www.soonersports.com/>
* <http://www.kuathletics.com/>
* <http://www.kstatesports.com/>

##Step Five: Style Tile##
After getting a feel for the Seminoles branding and identity and seeing other sites in the market, I started a style tile.

##Step Six: Layout Sketches##
Using the information from the personas, I placed the elements on the page in order of importance from the fan's perspectives. I also grouped elements together when I thought it made the most sense. For example, I grouped the image gallery and tweets with the rest of the media. The podcast section too -I assumed it was a little less important. I have nothing against podcasts for the record.

##Step Seven: Mockup##
My final step was to create a high-fidelity mockup of the FSU homepage in PhotoShop. I applied what I learned from the evaluation and market review and I used the style tile as a guide. I spent about sixteen hours on this step, here's what I was thinking along the way;

![FSU Homepage](2015-08-11-fsu-homepage-redesign/fsu_homepage_browser.jpg)

__Header__

Keep it simple, think mobile first (responsive)

__Hero__

* Use large images
* Add controls to change the headline
* Add an area that can be used for advertising, in this case, for football tickets

__Scores and Schedule__

* Use the re-skinned ribbon that was provided

__Store__

* Find the most popular hat and t-shirt sold and use images of them in the call-to-action
* Add the 'starting from' prices to appeal to student fans

__Tickets__

* Now that I know when the game is, and I have my t-shirt and hat, I need tickets to the game
* Add images of the players to add depth and appeal to the users emotions... This is who I am going to see

__Media__

* Show in chronological order top to bottom, right to left
* Use 'masonry' style 
* Sort media based on type (article, video, image gallery, tweet)
* Add podcast to the media section, it's media

__TicketsChampions Campaign__

* Appeal to donors
* Describe what it is 
* This needs to look 'luxurious' to appeal to a wealthy demo

__Booster__

* Another appeal to donors
* Make it feel more personable by adding a player... This is who you're helping to support

__Email Newsletter__

* I'm still not convinced a lot of people will use this

__Footer__

* Keep the logos grouped together
